 HMPS_FAQ.1.f:0 "This FAQ is intended for important answers to questions that cannot be reasonably understood via game GUI. It is not a tutorial."

 HMPS_FAQ.1.g:0 "Cancel"
 HMPS_FAQ.2.t:0 "Economy FAQ"
 HMPS_FAQ.2.d:0 "There are many changes to the economy in HMPS, however these are the least obvious and most potentially frustrating if misunderstood."
 HMPS_FAQ.2.a:0 "Agriculture Rework"
 HMPS_FAQ.2.a.t:0 "Due to Malthusian and technological limits, farms cannot be constructed until intensive agriculture is researched. At game start, subsistence agriculture is your only source of grain. Cheap natural fertilizer (guano) can be found around the world. Furthermore, both livestock and timber only employ half as many workers as farms due to increased land requirements. Be careful, as overbuilding these while still having peasants may lead to mass unemployment and starvation. "
 HMPS_FAQ.2.b:0 "Qualifications"
 HMPS_FAQ.2.b.t:0 "Almost all pops have higher Education Level requirements for promotion. The most important are machinists (25% Education Level) and engineers. (60% Education level). Furthermore, religious and cultural discrimination heavily restrict pop promotion."
 HMPS_FAQ.2.c:0 "Go Back"
 HMPS_FAQ.3.t:0 "Defines FAQ"
 HMPS_FAQ.3.d:0 "The Defines file is where many values for this game are hardcoded. This list is not exhaustive and prioiritizes changes that are difficult to find by playing the game."
 HMPS_FAQ.3.a:0 "Minor Adjustments"
 HMPS_FAQ.3.a.t:0 "State incorporation time has been increased.\nSecession happens at 70% Turmoil rather than 50%.\nSlave migration with slave trade has been increased"\nPop growth maxes out at 15 SoL"
 HMPS_FAQ.3.b:0 "War Support"
 HMPS_FAQ.3.b.t:0 "War support ticks every 28 days rather than 7, resulting in longer wars. Furthermore occupying all of a nation's pops will result in a more rapid drop in WS."
 HMPS_FAQ.3.c:0 "Radicals and Loyalists"
 HMPS_FAQ.3.c.t:0 "Loyalist growth rate has been halved while radical growth rate has been reduced by a third. As a result radicals grow relatively faster than in vanilla. This is largely because of an exploit where unlimited loyalists were possible."
 HMPS_FAQ.4.t:0 "Diplomacy FAQ"
 HMPS_FAQ.4.d:0 "There are not that many changes to diplomacy, however due to the limitations of modding diplomacy in Vic3, there are some confusing changes if not explicitly stated."
 HMPS_FAQ.4.a:0 "Diplomatic Demands"
 HMPS_FAQ.4.a.t:0 "We have attempted to remove Ban Slavery and Regime Change as they are memey, extremely exploitable, and have little non-LARP value. Unfortunately we only partially succeeded. While these war goals were removed from the code and cannot be used to declare war, they can somehow still be added after the diplo play begins. This is unable to be removed so we have banned doing this in our games. We recommend doing the same."
 HMPS_FAQ.4.b:0 "Defeat Modifiers"
 HMPS_FAQ.4.b.t:0 "We have made the Open Market modfiier much harsher, debuffing authority, IG approval, and legitimacy. Open Market also lasts 10 years in full, not 5 years decaying."
 HMPS_FAQ.4.c:0 "India Transfer"
 HMPS_FAQ.4.c.t:0 "If India is released, it will shatter like China. If it is from one country to another, an event will fire that will either: reduce infamy by 60 and release India (shattering it), or keeping it as a subject and paying a fine based on the income of all Indian subject states."
 HMPS_FAQ.4.e:0 "Ask for X for Sway In"
 HMPS_FAQ.4.e.t:0 "We have removed the ability for a player to 'Ask for X in return to sway in' during a diplomatic play. The reason for this is that, when ever a player 'Asks for X in return to sway in' in a diplomatic play, they do not have to pay any 'Diplomatic Maneuvers'. In multiplayer this can be abused and is difficult to keep track of. For this reason we have removed the ability for a player to 'Ask for X in return to sway in'. This change does not impact players ability to provide 'Unconditional Support' to either side of a diplomatic play. Similarly this does not a war leader 'Offering X in return for a sway in'"
 HMPS_FAQ.5.t:0 "Misc. MP FAQ"
 HMPS_FAQ.5.d:0 "These are various multiplayer questions related to MP that are not entirely obvious or have an impact on game quality."
 HMPS_FAQ.5.a:0 "OOS Protocol"
 HMPS_FAQ.5.a.t:0 "If a player OOSes, tell them to ignore the warning and drag it off to the side. Do not click either button. Do not leave the game until you see phantom civil wars or are unable to click events."
 HMPS_FAQ.5.b:0 "Last-Player OOS"
 HMPS_FAQ.5.b.t:0 "The last player to join a game (after the first session) has an extremely high chance to OOS."
 HMPS_FAQ.5.c:0 "Rehosting"
 HMPS_FAQ.5.c.t:0 "Rehosting is generally not necessary. Only rehost if almost everyone OOSes or keeps crashing, only then rehost. Sometimes there is an issue with the save and the best way to proceed is to simply force your way through it and temporarily kick the players who are having the worst issues."
 HMPS_FAQ.5.e:0 "Keybinds mods"
 HMPS_FAQ.5.e.t:0 "If you in SP and are confused about why the spacebar and number row has been disabled, then 1) read the Steam page! and 2) download the keybinds mod. The keybinds mod changes your checksum so remember to turn it off when you're re-enter MP."
 HMPS_FAQ.5.g:0 "Game Rules"
 HMPS_FAQ.5.g.t:0 "A link to game rules can also be found on the Steam page -- this page might be outdated so it is also adviseable to check the HMPS Discord."
