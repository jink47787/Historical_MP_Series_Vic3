 HMPS_FAQ.2.a:0 "Agriculture Rework"
 HMPS_FAQ.2.a.t:0 "Due to Malthusian and technological limits, farms cannot be constructed until intensive agriculture is researched. At game start, subsistence agriculture is your only source of grain. Cheap natural fertilizer (guano) can be found around the world. Furthermore, both livestock and timber only employ half as many workers as farms due to increased land requirements. Be careful, as overbuilding these while still having peasants may lead to mass unemployment and starvation. "

 HMPS_FAQ.3.c:0 "Radicals and Loyalists"
 HMPS_FAQ.3.c.t:0 "Loyalist growth rate has been halved while radical growth rate has been reduced by a third. As a result radicals grow relatively faster than in vanilla. This is largely because of an exploit where unlimited loyalists were possible."

 HMPS_FAQ.4.a.t:0 "We have attempted to remove Ban Slavery and Regime Change as they are memey, extremely exploitable, and have little non-LARP value. Unfortunately we only partially succeeded. While these war goals were removed from the code and cannot be used to declare war, they can somehow still be added after the diplo play begins. This is unable to be removed so we have banned doing this in our games. We recommend doing the same."
 HMPS_FAQ.4.b:0 "Defeat Modifiers"
 HMPS_FAQ.4.b.t:0 "We have made the Open Market modfiier much harsher, debuffing authority, IG approval, and legitimacy. Open Market also lasts 10 years in full, not 5 years decaying."

 HMPS_FAQ.4.e:0 "Ask for X for Sway In"
 HMPS_FAQ.4.e.t:0 "We have removed the ability for a player to 'Ask for X in return to sway in' during a diplomatic play. The reason for this is that, when ever a player 'Asks for X in return to sway in' in a diplomatic play, they do not have to pay any 'Diplomatic Maneuvers'. In multiplayer this can be abused and is difficult to keep track of. For this reason we have removed the ability for a player to 'Ask for X in return to sway in'. This change does not impact players ability to provide 'Unconditional Support' to either side of a diplomatic play. Similarly this does not a war leader 'Offering X in return for a sway in'"

 HMPS_FAQ.5.a:0 "OOS Protocol"

 HMPS_FAQ.5.c:0 "Rehosting"
 HMPS_FAQ.5.c.t:0 "Rehosting is generally not necessary. Only rehost if almost everyone OOSes or keeps crashing, only then rehost. Sometimes there is an issue with the save and the best way to proceed is to simply force your way through it and temporarily kick the players who are having the worst issues."
 HMPS_FAQ.5.e:0 "Keybinds mods"
 HMPS_FAQ.5.e.t:0 "If you in SP and are confused about why the spacebar and number row has been disabled, then 1) read the Steam page! and 2) download the keybinds mod. The keybinds mod changes your checksum so remember to turn it off when you're re-enter MP."
