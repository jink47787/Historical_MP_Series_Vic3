	# different from other contexts in that it is always 'active' (if

== Mouse button values ==
# Currently, only the extra buttons (X1 and X2) on the mouse can be mapped.
# The valid values are:
	- "MOUSE_X1"
	- "MOUSE_X2"

== Gamepad button values ==
# The gamepad is modeled after an XInput gamepad. Values that can be mapped are:
	- "GAMEPAD_A"
	- "GAMEPAD_B"
	- "GAMEPAD_X"
	- "GAMEPAD_Y"
	- "GAMEPAD_START"
	- "GAMEPAD_BACK"
	- "GAMEPAD_LSTICK" # Refers to 'clicking' the left stick

	- "GAMEPAD_DPAD_UP"
