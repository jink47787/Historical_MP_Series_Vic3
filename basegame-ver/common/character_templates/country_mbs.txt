### MOMBASA ###
# The Mazrui dynasty is often called Arab in many texts, as the dynasty did have Arab origins. By the 19th century, however, they had been established in Mombasa and intermarried with local patrician families for generations, and following Busaidi conquest became a focal point for anti-Zanzibari resistance. It feels appropriate to depict the Victorian Mazruis as essentially Swahili.
# The dynasty only transitioned from Ibadi to Shafi'i teachings after the Busaidi dynasty drove them out of Mombasa. This hasn't happened yet in 1836.
